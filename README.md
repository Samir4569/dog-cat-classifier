# Dog-Cat Classifier 🐶🐱  

A deep learning-based image classifier that distinguishes between dogs and cats using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built with TensorFlow and Keras.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Preprocessing of images (grayscale conversion, resizing, and normalization).  
- Three CNN models with different architectures for comparison.  
- Performance visualization using Matplotlib.  
- Model training with TensorFlow and Keras.  

## 📂 Dataset  
This project uses the `PetImages` dataset from Microsoft. Ensure your dataset is structured as:
